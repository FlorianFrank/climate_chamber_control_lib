# ClimateChamberControlLib

This project provides a library to control a Weisstechnik LabEvent climate chamber via an API interface. 
It allows to set the humidity and temperature, receive error messages and warnings and acknowledge them. 
The current temperature and humidity can be received by a callback function.

**Some parts of this documentation are currently missing bur will be added soon.**

## 1. Installation

Download the latest release on GitHub or clone the repository and compile it by your self. 

### 1.1 Manually compile the library

#### 1.2 Required packages

- CMAKE
- make (Linux)
- Ninja (Windows)

#### On Linux
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FlorianFrank/climate_chamber_control_lib.git
./compile.sh
```

#### On Windows
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FlorianFrank/climate_chamber_control_lib.git
./compile.ps
```

By running **compile.sh** or **compile.ps** the library, a test application as well as the underlying abstraction library 
**common_tools_lib** providing basic functionality like logging or sockets is build. Finally, the library, headers, and the 
test application is installed in the **bin** folder and has the following structure: 
```
ðŸ“¦ project
â”‚     
â””â”€â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ bin
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ lib
â”‚   â”‚    â”‚  ðŸ“œ climate_chamber_control_lib
â”‚   â”‚    â”‚  ðŸ“œ common_tools_lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ bin
â”‚   â”‚     |  ðŸ“œ ClimateChamberTest.exe
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ include
â”‚        |  ðŸ“œ <include files>
â”‚
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ tmp
     â”‚   ðŸ“œ <temporary files which can be deleted after the build>
```

## 2. Run a simple test program

### 2.1 Using the C++-interface

Link the climate_chamber_control.lib to your project and include the header file climate_chamber_control.h.
    
e.g. using CMAKE
```cmake
project(SampleProject)

add_subproject(instrument_control_lib)

add_executable(SampleProject main.cpp)
target_include_directory(SampleProject PUBLIC climate_chamber_control_lib/include)
target_link_libraries(SampleProject climate_chamber_control)
```

A sample program on how to use the climate chamber is provided in following code snipped:

```c++
#include <ClimateChamberControl.h>

int main() {
    ClimateChamberControl chamber;
    if(!chamber.initialize("<your_ip_address>")) // The standard port to access the climate chamber is 8080
        std::cout << "Error: " << chamber.GetLastError() << std::endl;
        
    chamber.setTargetTemperature(26.5);
    chamber.setTargetHumidity(30.0);
    
    chamber.startMonitorThread(5000);
    
    auto callback = [](float humidity, float temperature) {
        std::cout << "Humidity: " << humidity << " Temperature: " << temperature << std::endl;
    };
    
    chamber.RegisterTemperatureCallback(callback);
    
    chamber.startExecution();
    
    /*** Do some stuff here ***/

    chamber.stopExecution();
    chamber.Deinitialize();
```

### 2.1 Using the python-interface

The library can be accessed by a python interface as well. To run the library requires a python version < ??. 
The climate_chamber_control_library can be accessed by copying the library file directly next to the python script and
by importing it using following command: 

```python
from climate_chamber_control import *
```

The api itself is identical to the C++ API described in Section 3. 

```python
from climate_chamber_control import *

chamber = ClimateChamberControl()

if not chamber.initialize("<your_ip_address>"):
    chamber.GetLastError()

chamber.setTargetTemperature(26.5)
chamber.setTargetHumidity(30.0)

chamber.startMonitorThread(5000)

callback = lambda humidity, temperature: print("Humidity: " + str(humidity) + " Temperature: " + str(temperature))

chamber.RegisterTemperatureCallback(callback)
chamber.startExecution()

# Do some stuff here

chamber.stopExecution()
chamber.Deinitialize()
```
