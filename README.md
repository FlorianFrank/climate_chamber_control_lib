# climate chamber lib

This project provides a library to control a Weisstechnik LabEvent climate chamber via an API interface. 
It allows to set the humidity and temperature, receive error messages and warnings and acknowledge them. 
The current temperature and humidity can be received by a callback function.

## Continuous integration

We maintain the compatibility with different compilers and operating systems by compiling the libary 
on different systems. The current status of the continuous integration can be found here:

## 1. Installation

Download the latest release on GitHub or clone the repository and compile it by your self. 

### 1.1 Manually compile the library

#### 1.2 Required packages

- CMAKE
- make (Linux)
- Ninja (Windows)
- MinGW (Windows)

#### On Linux
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FlorianFrank/climate_chamber_control_lib.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
./compile.sh
```

#### On Windows
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FlorianFrank/climate_chamber_control_lib.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
./compile.ps1
```

By running **compile.sh** or **compile.ps** the library, a test application as well as the underlying abstraction library 
**common_tools_lib** providing basic functionality like logging or sockets is build. Finally, the library, headers, and the 
test application is installed in the **bin** folder and has the following structure: 
```
ðŸ“¦ project
â”‚     
â””â”€â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ bin

```

## 2. Run a simple test program

### 2.1 Using the C++-interface

Link the climate_chamber_lib to your project and include the header file climate_chamber_control.h.
    
e.g. using CMAKE
```cmake
project(SampleProject)

add_subproject(instrument_control_lib)

add_executable(SampleProject main.cpp)
target_include_directory(SampleProject PUBLIC climate_chamber_control_lib/include)
target_link_libraries(SampleProject climate_chamber_control)
```

A sample program on how to use the climate chamber is provided in following code snipped:

```c++
#include <ClimateChamberControl.h>

int main() {
    ClimateChamberControl chamber;
    if(!chamber.initialize("<your_ip_address>")) // The standard port to access the climate chamber is 8080
        std::cout << "Error: " << chamber.GetLastError() << std::endl;
        
    chamber.setTargetTemperature(26.5);
    chamber.setTargetHumidity(30.0);
    
    chamber.startMonitorThread(5000);
    
    auto callback = [](float humidity, float temperature) {
        std::cout << "Humidity: " << humidity << " Temperature: " << temperature << std::endl;
    };
    
    chamber.RegisterTemperatureCallback(callback);
    
    chamber.startExecution();
    
    /*** Do some stuff here ***/

    chamber.stopExecution();
    chamber.Deinitialize();
```

### 2.1 Using the python-interface

The library can be accessed by a python interface as well. To run the library requires a python version > 3.10. 
The lib can be installed using pip by executing `pip install .` in the root directory of this project.
You can import it using the following command: 

```python
from py_climate_chamber_lib import *
```

The api itself is identical to the C++ API described in Section 3. 

```python
from py_climate_chamber_lib import *

chamber = ClimateChamberControl()

if not chamber.initialize("<your_ip_address>"):
    chamber.get_last_error()

chamber.set_target_temperature(26.5)
chamber.set_target_humidity(30.0)

chamber.start_monitor_thread(5000)

callback = lambda humidity, temperature: print("Humidity: " + str(humidity) + " Temperature: " + str(temperature))

chamber.register_humid_temp_callback(callback)
chamber.start_execution()

# Do some stuff here

chamber.stop_execution()
chamber.deinitialize()
```
